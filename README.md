# Vacation Planner

## Description

This application is to assist in the planning of a successful vacation by providing an itinerary, weather and a map for each location for each day:

- The motivation for this application is to help plan a successful trip by providing critical weather and navigation information including:
    - a local map
    - an icon showing the forecasted weather - sunny, cloudy, raining ....
    - forecasted high and low temperature
    - forecasted humidity
    - forecasted UVI
    - forecasted sunrise and sunset times

- We are building this application to provide the type of information for a trip that we would like to know in one place.  
- There is also the added benefit of enhancing out frontend development skills as well as our project planning and collaboration skills.
